# Task: UI Polish & Responsive Design

## Description
Polish the entire frontend with mobile-first responsive layouts, navigation system (bottom nav for mobile, side nav for desktop), campus color theming, loading states, error handling, and PWA configuration. This task runs alongside feature development to ensure consistent UI quality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Root layout with auth guard (redirect to /login if unauthenticated)
- [ ] Main layout with bottom navigation (mobile: Home, Search, Create, Messages, Profile)
- [ ] Main layout with side navigation (desktop: expanded menu with all sections)
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints: mobile (<768px), tablet (768-1024px), desktop (>1024px)
- [ ] Campus color theming: user's campus color as accent throughout UI (pilani=red, goa=green, hyderabad=purple, dubai=orange)
- [ ] Skeleton loaders for all data-fetching pages (feed, messages, profiles, communities)
- [ ] Empty states with illustrations for: no posts, no messages, no connections, no communities
- [ ] Error boundary component wrapping all routes
- [ ] Toast notification system (success, error, warning, info) using Shadcn/ui
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh on mobile for feed and message list
- [ ] PWA manifest.json with app name, icons, theme color
- [ ] Service worker for basic offline support (cache static assets)
- [ ] Smooth page transitions and loading indicators
- [ ] Consistent spacing, typography, and color usage across all pages
- [ ] Accessible: keyboard navigation, aria labels, focus indicators, 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- [ ] Dark mode toggle with system preference detection

## Technical Details
- Bottom nav: fixed position, 5 icons with labels, active state indicator, badge for unread messages/notifications
- Side nav: collapsible, shows user avatar + name, navigation links, campus badge
- Campus theming: CSS custom properties set from user's campus, applied to primary accent colors
- Skeleton loaders: Shadcn/ui Skeleton component with realistic content shapes
- Error boundary: React error boundary with "Something went wrong" fallback + retry button
- Toast: Shadcn/ui toast/sonner with auto-dismiss and action buttons
- PWA: next-pwa package or manual service worker, manifest in public/
- Dark mode: Tailwind dark: classes, theme stored in localStorage, system preference via prefers-color-scheme
- Responsive images: Next.js Image component with sizes prop for breakpoints

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Project foundation (Tailwind, Shadcn/ui setup)
- [ ] Task 004: Basic pages exist to polish

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20
- Parallel: true (runs alongside feature tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] App is fully responsive from 320px to 2560px width
- [ ] Navigation works correctly on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Campus colors apply based on logged-in user
- [ ] All pages have skeleton loaders and empty states
- [ ] Error boundaries catch and display errors gracefully
- [ ] PWA is installable on mobile browsers
- [ ] Dark mode toggles correctly
- [ ] Lighthouse accessibility score > 80
