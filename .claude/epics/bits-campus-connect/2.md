# Task: Monorepo & Project Foundation

## Description
Set up the pnpm monorepo workspace with all three packages: apps/web (Next.js 14 with App Router), apps/api (Express with TypeScript), and packages/shared (shared types, schemas, constants). Configure TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and environment variables across all packages.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] pnpm-workspace.yaml configured with apps/* and packages/*
- [ ] apps/web: Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui initialized
- [ ] apps/api: Express server with TypeScript, nodemon for dev, proper folder structure (routes/, controllers/, services/, middleware/, socket/, utils/)
- [ ] packages/shared: TypeScript package with build setup, exports for types/constants/schemas
- [ ] Root package.json with workspace scripts: dev, dev:web, dev:api, build, lint, test
- [ ] Shared ESLint config with TypeScript strict mode rules
- [ ] Prettier config for consistent formatting
- [ ] .env.example files for both apps with all required variables
- [ ] .gitignore covering node_modules, .env, build artifacts, .next
- [ ] Root tsconfig.json with project references

## Technical Details
- Use pnpm 8+ with workspace protocol
- Next.js 14 with app/ directory structure
- Express with ts-node-dev or tsx for development
- Shared package uses tsup or tsc for building
- Tailwind CSS configured in apps/web with Shadcn/ui CLI initialized
- Socket.io and Socket.io-client as dependencies in respective packages

## Dependencies
- [ ] None - this is the first task

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-12
- Parallel: false (blocks everything else)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] `pnpm install` succeeds from root
- [ ] `pnpm dev` starts both web (localhost:3000) and api (localhost:8000)
- [ ] `pnpm build` compiles all packages without errors
- [ ] `pnpm lint` passes with no errors
- [ ] Shared package types importable from both apps
